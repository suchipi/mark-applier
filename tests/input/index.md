# Index

This is the index page. Neat, huh?

Here is a link to [some page](./some-page), and here is _another_ link, this time to [some `other` page!](./some-other-page.md). There's also a link to [a third page](./some-subfolder/something.html) here, as well. ~~Fancy that!~~

---

That first link had no filename extension, and that second link had a `.md` extension, and that third link had a `.html` extension. Those all work and resolve properly.

## Templating

Here's some templated content between the words "apple" and "banana":

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
- apple
%%TEMPLATED_CONTENT_EXAMPLE%%
- banana
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

You reached the bottom of the page! Congrats. Maybe you want to go to <https://google.com> next?
